        Since our inception in 2014, 4Ward 2Gether has been dedicated to spreading the message of diversity and inclusion, combating prejudice, and fostering community unity.
        <br><br>
        Based in Ayrshire, 4Ward 2Gether is a non-profit organisation led by passionate volunteers. We design engaging sessions that promote open discussions about anti-discrimination. Our unique programs offer young people the opportunity to travel to Northern Ireland to learn about prejudice and challenge biases.
        <br><br>
        We extend our gratitude to the South Scotland National Lottery Fund and the various groups that have supported our Diversity Weekends
